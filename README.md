# Solar Bike

Notes for building an open hardware solar transportation vehicle.

# Constraints

* Can run at the speed of traffic on secondary roads (40-60 km/h);
* Require limited manufacturing skills:
  * Ideally no soldering or custom frame building;
* Use as many standard bike and solar energy components as possible;
* Can be easily assembled and disassembled in 10-15 min;
* Fits in an average appartment storage space after disassembly;
* Fits 2-4 people actively pedalling: when less than 4 people, the extra space can be replaced by carrying capacity for luggage. 

# Design Concept

## Observations

* Aerodynamism is much better in a pack of cyclists than for an individual cyclist, even if a given cyclist is not really aerodynamic: only the front of the pack need to "break the air", the rest benefit from the inertia;
* Solar power depends on the total surface of the solar panels;
* The key factor is the power/weight ratio.

Therefore the ideal solar bike would have no weight, an infinite surface of solar panels, and an infinite number of super fit people pedaling under the panels in a tight pack to minimize the frontal area.


# Preliminary Design

## Typical Cyclist Dimensions

* Stationary width: 0.6m 
* Essential maneuvering space width: 0.9m
* Length: 1.5-1.8m
